# CipherSwarmAgent

> A distributed hash-cracking agent for the CipherSwarm ecosystem, built with Go. Manages and executes cryptographic tasks across Linux, macOS, and Windows with real-time monitoring, automatic recovery, and robust task state persistence.

CipherSwarmAgent is a high-performance CLI client that connects to CipherSwarm servers to receive, execute, and report on password cracking tasks using hashcat. The agent features enhanced task monitoring with system metrics collection, automatic recovery mechanisms for network failures and process crashes, and comprehensive task state management for reliable distributed computing.
