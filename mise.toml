# Python, Go, and Bun are listed as latest specifically so that they will use the idiomatic version file to determine the version to use. This allows us to have a single source of truth for the versions of these languages, and it also allows us to easily update the versions by simply updating the idiomatic version file.

# cyclonedx-gomod: installed via go install in CI (mise shim causes trust issues in goreleaser subprocesses)
