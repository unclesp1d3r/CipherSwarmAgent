# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Task Monitoring and Recovery System will provide robust task lifecycle management, real-time monitoring capabilities, and automatic recovery mechanisms for the CipherSwarmAgent. This system must maintain compatibility with the existing v1 Agent API contract while adding comprehensive monitoring, persistence, and recovery capabilities. The implementation should be designed to support the planned language migration while preserving all current functionality including hashcat integration, cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows), and distributed task execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive task monitoring with real-time status updates, so that I can track the health and progress of distributed cracking operations across multiple agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is accepted by the agent THEN the system SHALL create a detailed task execution log with timestamps, task metadata, hashcat parameters, and initial system state
2. WHEN a task is executing THEN the system SHALL collect and report performance metrics including hash rate, temperature, memory usage, GPU utilization, and progress percentage at configurable intervals (default 3 seconds)
3. WHEN system resources exceed defined thresholds (GPU temperature, memory usage, disk space) THEN the system SHALL automatically throttle or pause task execution and log the throttling event
4. WHEN a task completes successfully THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive completion report with execution statistics, resource utilization summary, and cracked hash count
5. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing `/tasks/{id}/submit_status` API endpoint format
6. WHEN the agent sends heartbeats THEN the system SHALL include current task status and system health metrics in the heartbeat payload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an agent operator, I want automatic task recovery capabilities, so that temporary failures don't result in lost work and the agent can continue operating without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network connection is lost during task execution THEN the system SHALL pause the current hashcat process and attempt reconnection using exponential backoff (starting at 1 second, max 300 seconds)
2. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL validate the task is still active with the server and resume the paused task from the last known checkpoint
3. WHEN a hashcat process crashes unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL capture the exit code and stderr, then automatically restart the process with identical parameters and resume from the last progress point
4. IF a task fails more than 3 consecutive times THEN the system SHALL mark the task as failed and report the failure to the server using the `/agents/{id}/submit_error` endpoint with detailed error information
5. WHEN GPU temperature exceeds the configured threshold (default 80°C) THEN the system SHALL pause task execution and resume when temperature drops below the threshold minus 5°C
6. WHEN the agent process is terminated unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL be able to resume incomplete tasks on restart without data loss
7. WHEN resuming a task THEN the system SHALL verify task parameters haven't changed on the server before continuing execution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured task state persistence, so that agent restarts don't lose task progress and the system can recover gracefully from unexpected shutdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task begins execution THEN the system SHALL persist task state including task ID, attack ID, hashcat parameters, progress position, and execution metadata to local storage in JSON format
2. WHEN task progress updates occur THEN the system SHALL atomically update the persisted state with current progress information, keyspace position, and timestamp
3. WHEN the agent starts up THEN the system SHALL scan for incomplete task state files and automatically attempt to resume them
4. WHEN resuming an incomplete task THEN the system SHALL validate the task is still active on the server via `/tasks/{id}` endpoint before continuing execution
5. WHEN a task is completed, cancelled, or marked as exhausted THEN the system SHALL clean up the persisted state files and any temporary data
6. WHEN state persistence fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but continue task execution to avoid blocking operations
7. WHEN multiple agents run on the same system THEN the system SHALL use agent-specific state directories to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable monitoring and alerting thresholds, so that I can customize the monitoring behavior based on my specific hardware and operational requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts THEN the system SHALL load monitoring configuration from the YAML config file with sensible defaults (GPU temp: 80°C, memory threshold: 90%, disk space: 1GB)
2. WHEN monitoring thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warning or error messages using structured logging
3. IF custom monitoring rules are defined in configuration THEN the system SHALL evaluate and apply those rules during task execution
4. WHEN configuration supports it THEN the system SHALL allow per-device thresholds for multi-GPU systems
5. WHEN the system detects configuration file changes THEN the system SHALL reload monitoring parameters without requiring agent restart
6. WHEN environment variables or CLI flags override config file values THEN the system SHALL prioritize the override values for monitoring thresholds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an agent operator, I want detailed task execution history and analytics, so that I can analyze performance trends and optimize my cracking operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL store execution history including task ID, duration, average/peak hash rates, resource usage peaks, crack count, and success/failure status in local database or structured files
2. WHEN requested via CLI command THEN the system SHALL provide task execution statistics including success rate, average performance metrics, and failure analysis
3. WHEN storage limits are reached (configurable, default 100MB) THEN the system SHALL automatically rotate old execution logs while preserving recent history (default 30 days)
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide task history in structured formats (JSON, CSV) for external analysis and integration with monitoring tools
5. WHEN benchmark data is collected THEN the system SHALL store historical benchmark results to track performance degradation over time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer implementing the new language version, I want clear API compatibility requirements, so that the new implementation maintains full compatibility with existing CipherSwarm server infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing monitoring features THEN the system SHALL maintain strict compatibility with all existing v1 Agent API endpoints defined in `docs/swagger.json`
2. WHEN sending status updates THEN the system SHALL use the exact JSON schema format expected by the current server implementation
3. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL support the existing Bearer token authentication mechanism
4. WHEN reporting errors THEN the system SHALL use the structured error format defined in the current API specification
5. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL not break existing server-side expectations for agent behavior
6. WHEN the agent shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly notify the server using the existing `/agents/{id}/shutdown` endpoint
